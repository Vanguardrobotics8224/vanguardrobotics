		 <h2>2025 REEFSCAPE</h2>
        <p>We used a new tank drive base powered by four heavily used CIM motors. Unlike previous builds, the design was entirely created in CAD during the season by a member. The small core group of 3 students and 2 mentors completely built this robot in just 5 days in a single car garage. We finished the physical assembly only 9 hours before the competition begain. The robot was programmed using WPI Lib in C++. During the competition, the elevator mechanism struggled due to a slight misalignment in the rapid build process. The team was fortunate to receive invaluable technical assistance and support on-site from fellow teams 4955 (LA Tech), 3990 (Tech4Kids), and Team 396 (Northern Nights). The team proudly served as a backup robot for Alliance 4 and ultimately finished 29th out of 37 teams at the Festival Robotique du Quebec.

		 <h2>2024 CRESENDO</h2>
        <p>Our team developed a robot featuring a tank drive base powered by four CIM motors. The unique shooter mechanism demonstrated early ingenuity, constructed from compression wheels, duct tape, and tin metal. This base was made drivable using older control components, and the robot was coded in LabVIEW with the essential assistance of John from FIRST Quebec. According to team member William, this project candidly highlighted the team's initial "lack of knowledge of robotics," perfectly encapsulating the steep learning curve as it was the first robot built by a genuinely formed team of dedicated students. Aesthetically, the robot featured custom bumpers spray-painted with stencils. The team placed 38th out of 40 participants at the highly competitive Quebec Regional event. This formative experience was invaluable for the eight participating students and single mentor. The 2024 team extends a special shout-out and thank you to John from FIRST Quebec for his exceptional help and guidance during this foundational effort.

		 <h2>2022 RAPID REACT</h2>
        <p>We utilized tank drive base powered by new CIM motors sourced from the official Kit of Parts. Despite the significant challenge of building a robot in a very short amount of time, a dedicated small team of four students, one mentor, and John from FIRST Quebec successfully executed the project. Students competently handled all CAD work using Onshape with John's guidance, building the robot according to the official KitBot specifications. In our debut competition event, the team secured three wins against six losses, concluding the event with the esteemed Judges' Choice Award and gaining invaluable experience for our first year in FRC competition.

		 <h2>2025 CRC TakTik</h2>
<p>For the CRC (Canadian Robotics Competition) event, the team invested in a go-builder kit to construct a robust base, utilizing REV Robotics motor controls and motors throughout the system. This robot was meticulously built over the course of the entire year, resulting in a very well-constructed machine. While the team was proud of their efficient and decent final design, they noted that with slightly more time they could have fully implemented a central shooting mechanism that would have elevated the robot to a truly exceptional level. The team performed admirably in the competition, placing within the top 13 overall. They advanced through the quarter-finals and into the semi-finals, being eliminated in the final game of that round. The entire experience was highly positive, and all members had a tremendous amount of fun participating.

		 <h2>2024 CRC Kryptik</h2>
        <p>We built the drive base using pre-drilled aluminum stock and incorporated a mixed wheel setup: two front wheels were omnidirectional wheels to improve turning maneuverability, while the back end utilized two standard tank drive wheels configured in a dual arrangement. We powered this system using go-builda motors, both of which unfortunately burned out midway through the competition, requiring immediate troubleshooting and replacement.There was the same component used from the FRC robot from 2024, to shoot the dodge balls.
