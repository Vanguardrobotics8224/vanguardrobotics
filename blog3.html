Read his full speech and see Vanguard School through the eyes of one of our students!
—
Hello, my name is Jacob,
 
I am in grade 11 in the english sector here at Vanguard High School. I’ve been at this school since grade 5. Coming to a new school alone without friends could have been intimidating, but at Vanguard, it was the complete opposite. From the very first day, I felt welcomed. I made friends right away, and over the years, I’ve come to see just how special this school really is.
 
When I first started, I was a shy kid who struggled in English and Math. At my old school, I often felt lost, and sometimes I was ready to give up. But here, things were different. I was given the support I needed, taught in ways I could understand, and encouraged to keep going. Every year, I felt myself improving, and it gave me the confidence to believe in my own success. What makes Vanguard unique is that so many of us share similar challenges. I find it really cool that at Vanguard they can teach everyone in the ways that they would understand best. It really shows you how much they care about their students. At Vanguard it is more than a place to learn—it’s a true community of people that care.
 
For the past three years, I’ve had the honor of representing the Vanguard Robotics Team as captain. When I first joined, our resources were limited — just a few tools, some scrap metal, and 2 workbenches. Today, thanks to the support we’ve received through events like this, we’ve grown into a team equipped with new technologies, upgraded tools, and programs that give every member the chance to not only learn valuable skills but also have fun while doing it.
 
At Vanguard, many students often see themselves as “the kids with learning disabilities.” But when we compete in robotics, you’d never know which schools or students have learning challenges. In fact, outside the classroom, we often excel beyond expectations. These events highlight not only the exceptional education provided at Vanguard, but also the impressive intellectual strengths of its students.
A learning disability doesn’t mean “less than.” It means resilient, driven, unstoppable. It means: watch out — because we work hard, and we’re here to win.
 
L’équipe de robotique est juste un exemple. Les activités offertes par l’école sont infinies. Des équipé sportives, aux clubs de jeux vidéo il y a quelque chose pour tout monde. Même des productions théâtrales ainsi que des sorties scolaires. Et en plus de la robotique! Il y en a vraiment pour tous les goûts. Ces activités nous aident à agrandir nos “leaders” de demain a Vanguard.
 
On behalf of all the students at Vanguard, I want to thank you for your sponsorship. Your contribution doesn’t just help us host a great tournament—it invests in the growth, confidence, and success of every Vanguard student, now and in the future.
 
Thank you.</span></p>
